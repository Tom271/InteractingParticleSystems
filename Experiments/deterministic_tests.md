# Testing the Deterministic System

To check everything is working as expected, we can first test the system with no noise, that is

$$
\begin{cases} \mathrm{d}x^{i,N}_t = v_t \mathrm{d}t, \\
\mathrm{d}v^{i,N}_t = \left(G\left(\frac{\sum_{j=1}^N \varphi(x^{i,N}_t - x^{j,N}_t) v^{j,N}_t}{\sum_{j=1}^N \varphi(x^{i,N}_t - x^{j,N}_t)}\right) - v_t\right)\mathrm{d}t.
\end{cases}
$$
This is a deterministic system. We will do a variety of tests. Throughout, we take the interaction function as
$\varphi(x) = \mathbb{I}_{[0,\gamma L]}(x) $, and the herding function as the smooth $G(u) =  \mathrm{atan}(u)/\mathrm{atan}(1)$.
