    \section{Model Implementation}
        The main difficulty in moving from the space homogenous to the two dimensional case is calculating the heterogeneity for every particle.
        
        The problem term is:
        \[
            G\left(\frac{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N v_t^{j,N}\varphi(x^{j,N}_t-x^{i,N}_t)}{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N \varphi(x^{j,N}_t-x^{i,N}_t)}\right).
        \]
        Let's unpack this term by term, and discuss their implementation.
        \subsection{Differences in Garnier's Model}
            Weighting interaction by N instead of $N_i$, length of space domain is 10, not $2\pi$.
