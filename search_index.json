The pdf version is a traditional static report compiled in LaTeX whereas the html version allows for the addition of animations describing the motion of the particles in the systems. Generally, these allow for a much more intuitive view of whats happening, rather than relying on one-dimensional plots. If youâ€™re on the html version and would like a pdf version, simply click on the Adobe Reader logo in the toolbar at the top of this page (or indeed on any page). It was created using Bookdown [1].
